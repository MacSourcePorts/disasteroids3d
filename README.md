# Disasteroids 3D
Disasteroids 3D is an OpenGL remake of Asteroids I created back in 2000. The source code has always been available for download from my site if you were looking for it, but I figured I'd throw it up on Github for people to poke around with it if they're motivated. 

This thing started from an OpenGL tutorial over on nehe.gamedev.net - it started from his code demonstrating the use of display lists. I realized that instead of rotating all the boxes with the keyboard, I could just use the keys to rotate one, then I spanwned the boxes at random locations and gave them random velocities and the game grew out of that.
